        <h1> Sum and product of roots </h1>
        <p> 07/04/2022 </p>
        <p> In this post I tried to come up with an explanation for why, given the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0,
        the sum of the roots of the equation is -b/a, and the product of the roots is c/a. </p>

        <p> For example, given the quadratic equation <i>2x^2 + 12x + 10 = 0</i>, the formula says that the sum of the roots (value of x)
        should be <i>-b/a = -12/2 = -6</i> and the product of the roots <i>c/a = 10/2 = 5</i>. Indeed, factoring the equation we get <i>(2x+2)(x+5)=0</i>,
        and the roots <i>x=-1</i> and <i>x=-5</i>.

        <h3> Why is the sum of two roots of a quadratic equation (-b/a) and the product (c/a)? </h3>

        <br>

        <p>
        <i>ax^2 + bx^1 + c = 0</i>
        </p>

        <p>
	For any quadratic equation <i>(mx - c)(nx - d) = 0</i> The roots of the quadratic equation are </i> x= c/m or x= d/n. </i>
	The coefficient of x^2 in the quadratic equation is the product of the coefficients of x in the simplified equation
        (<i>mn</i> because <i>(mn)x^2</i>). The coefficient of x in the expanded quadratic equation above is -cn + -dm. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Taking <i> b/a = -cn/nm + -dm/nm </i>, we obtain <i> -c/m + -d/n </i>, or the negative sum of the roots (wrong sign).
        To obtain the sum of the roots in the correct sign, we multiply <i>b/a</i> by -1 to get <i>-b/a</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
	Why multiply b/a with -1? When <i>mx-c = 0, x=c/m</i>. Note that the root itself (c/m) is positive, but the coefficient of x
        in the expanded equation is derived from negative c. We need to negate <i>b/a</i> because <i>b/a</i> is the sum of the negative 
        versions of the root. To correct for the negative c, we negate the number. Combining these findings, we get <i>-b/a</i>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        What about c/a? Consider <i>(mx - c)(nx + d) = 0</i>, where the roots are c/m and -d/n. The coefficient of x^0 (c in c/a) in the expanded 
        quadratic equation is (-c*d). The roots are c/m and -d/n. Take <i>(-c*d) / mn = -c/m * d/n</i>, we get the product of the roots.
        </p>

        <p>
        Note that it doesn't matter if which root (<i>c/m</i> and <i>d/n</i> in this case) is negative or positive - if they have exclusively
        different signs, the product will be negative. 
        </p>

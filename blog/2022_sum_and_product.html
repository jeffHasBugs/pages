        <h1> Sum and product of roots </h1>
        <p> 23/03/2022 </p>
        <p> In this post I tried to come up with an intuitive explanation for why, given the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0,
        the sum of the roots of the equation is -b/a, and the product of the roots is c/a. </p>


        <p>I spent more time than was necessary in attempting to write a clear explanation for my thought 
        processes. The explanation is not clear, nor concise, but I'm posting it here anyways because 
        I'm quite proud that I could even come up with an explanation. </p>

        <h3> <strong>Why is the sum of two roots of a quadratic equation (-b/a) and the product (c/a)?</strong> </h3>
        <p>
	a. Example x^2 - 18x + 81=0 ; RootA+RootB = -(-18/1) , RootA*RootB = 81/1 ;
        <br>
	b. Example 5x^2 - 9x + 4=0 ; RootA+RootB = -(-9/5) , RootA*RootB = 4/5 ;
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
	For any equation (mx - c)(nx - d) = 0, x= c/m <strong>or</strong> x= d/n. 
	The coefficient of x^2 in the quadratic equation is the product of the coefficients of x in the simplified equation.
	The coefficient of x in the expanded quadratic equation is cn + dm. Taking  cn/nm + dm/nm,
        we obtain c/m + d/n, or the sum of the roots, b/a!
        </p>

        <p>
	Why multiply b/a with -1? When (mx-c = 0), x=c/m , but the coefficient of x in the quadratic equation (the b in b/a) is 
        derived from -c! To correct for the negative c, we negate the number. Combining all these findings, we get -b/a.
        </p>

        <p>
        What about c/a? For (mx - c)(nx + d) = 0, the roots are c/m and -d/n. The coefficient of x^0 (c in c/a) in the expanded 
        quadratic equation is (-c*d). The roots are c/m and -d/n. Take (-c*d) / mn = -c/m * d/n, or the product of the roots.
        </p>

        <p>
        The product of the roots do not need to be negated. We are only taking the product of the roots.

        <h1> Sum and product of roots </h1>
        <p> 07/04/2022 </p>
        <p> In this post I tried to come up with an intuitive explanation for why, given the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0,
        the sum of the roots of the equation is -b/a, and the product of the roots is c/a. </p>


        <p>I spent more time than was necessary in attempting to write a clear explanation for my thought 
        processes. The explanation is not clear, nor concise, but I'm posting it here anyways. </p>

        <h3> <strong>Why is the sum of two roots of a quadratic equation (-b/a) and the product (c/a)?</strong> </h3>
        <p>
	a. <i>x^2 - 18x + 81=0</i> ; Root1+Root2 = -(-18/1) , Root1*Root2 = 81/1 ;
        <br>
	b. <i>5x^2 - 9x + 4=0 </i>; Root1+Root2 = -(-9/5) , Root1*Root2 = 4/5 ;
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
        <i>ax^2 + bx^1 + c = 0</i>
        </p>

        <p>
	For any equation <i>(mx - c)(nx - d) = 0</i> The roots of the quadratic equation are </i> x= c/m or x= d/n. </i>
	The coefficient of x^2 in the quadratic equation is the product of the coefficients of x in the simplified equation
        (<i>mn</i> because <i>(mn)x^2</i>). The coefficient of x in the expanded quadratic equation is cn + dm. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Taking <i> cn/nm + dm/nm </i>, we obtain <i> c/m + d/n </i>, or the sum of the roots, <i>b/a</i>!
        </p>

        <p>
	Why multiply b/a with -1? When <i>mx-c = 0, x=c/m</i>. Note that the root itself (c/m) is positive, but the coefficient of x
        (the variable b in -b/a, the formula) is derived from the negative c (-c). We need to negate <i>b/a</i> because <i>b/a</i> is the sum 
        of the negative versions of the root. To correct for the negative c, we negate the number. Combining all these findings, we get <i>-b/a</i>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        What about c/a? For <i>(mx - c)(nx + d) = 0</i>, the roots are c/m and -d/n. The coefficient of x^0 (c in c/a) in the expanded 
        quadratic equation is (-c*d). The roots are c/m and -d/n. Take <i>(-c*d) / mn = -c/m * d/n</i>, we get the product of the roots.
        </p>

        <p>
        Note that it doesn't matter if which root (<i>c</i> and <i>d</i> in this case) is negative or positive - if they have exclusively
        different signs, the product will be negative. 
        </p>

        <h1> Sum and product of roots </h1>
        <p> 07/04/2022 </p>

        <p>
        Given the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots of the equation is -b/a, and the product of the roots is c/a.
        </p>

        <p> For example, given the quadratic equation <i>2x^2 + 12x + 10 = 0</i>, the formula says that the sum of the roots (value of x)
        should be <i>-b/a = -12/2 = -6</i> and the product of the roots should be <i>c/a = 10/2 = 5</i>. Indeed, factoring the quadratic equation 
        we get <i>(2x+2)(x+5)=0</i>, and the roots <i>x=-1</i> and <i>x=-5</i>, which add up to -6 and multiply to 5.

        <h3> Why is the sum of two roots of a quadratic equation (-b/a) and the product (c/a)? </h3>

        <br>

        <p>
        <i>Quadratic equation: ax^2 + bx^1 + c = 0</i>
        </p>

        <p>
	For a quadratic equation that can be factored into the form <i>(mx - c)(nx - d) = 0</i>. Note that the roots (solutions) of the quadratic equation 
        are </i> x= c/m or x= d/n. </i> Expanding <i>(mx-c)(nx-d)</i>, we get <i>(mn)x^2 + (-cn-dm)x + cd</i>. The coefficient of x^2 in the 
        quadratic equation is the product of the coefficients of x in the simplified equation (<i>mn</i> because <i>(mn)x^2</i>). The coefficient
        of x in the expanded quadratic equation above is -cn + -dm. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Taking <i> b/a = -cn/nm + -dm/nm </i>, we obtain <i> -c/m + -d/n </i>, or the <strong>negative</strong> sum of the roots.
        </p>

        <p>
	To obtain the sum of the roots in the correct sign, we multiply b/a by -1. Let's go back to our factored equation <i>(mx - c)(nx - d) = 0</i>. When 
        <i>mx-c = 0, x=c/m</i>. Note that the root itself (c/m) is positive, but the coefficient of x in the expanded equation is derived from negative c 
        <i>(-cn-dm)</i>. Hence -b/a.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        What about c/a? Consider <i>(mx - c)(nx - d) = 0</i> again, where the roots are c/m and -d/n. The constant in the quadratic equation, 
        the c in c/a, in the expanded quadratic equation is (-c*-d). The roots are c/m and d/n. Take <i>(-c*-d) / mn = -c/m * -d/n</i>, we get the product of the roots.
        </p>

        <p>
        We don't have to worry about multiplying c/a with -1 because the sign of the individual terms of the multiplication (c/m and d/n, the roots) stops being important
        once you multiply them together. Multiplying both the terms by -1 won't change whether the product is positive or negative.

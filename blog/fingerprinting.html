        <h1> Evading fingerprinting is not worth your time </h1>
        <p> 27/05/2022 </p>
        <p> There is a config, privacy.resistFingerprinting in Firefox that tries to thwart attempts by websites to fingerprint the browser. </p>

        <p> On the surface, resistFingerprinting seems useful. It tries to prevent websites from fingerprinting the browser by 
        observing how your browser renders the canvas image. It reduces time precision on Javascript. It spoofs time zone, 
        locale, keyboard layout, and user agent. [1] </p>

        <p> The purpose is to make your browser look the same as everyone else's to websites (really, corporations) so that they
        cannot connect you to your past browsing habits whenever you visit a website. All seems proper, until you remember that 
        you cannot send the website an IP address that you do not have access to (how will the website send you data?), which
        means most of the time you are revealing your true location. Hiding your true IP address is tedious. </p>

        <p> Websites can also guess your browser version by testing for certain new features and also by known differences of 
        Javascript engines between browsers [2], making the fact that you're lying about your browser version a sudden, 
        obvious pain in the butt. </p>

        <p> We only talk about Firefox's resistFingerprinting, but many other browsers that try to evade fingerprinting do it the same 
        way, with the same flaws. When trying to evade fingerprinting hurts your browsing experience or consumes too much of your time, 
        with suboptimal results, it is not worth it. </p>

        <p> One other notable thing is that your operating system may send/process network data in a specific pattern. TCP/IP implementations 
        differ between operating systems. Websites can identify your operating system by exploiting this fact: 
        <a href="https://nmap.org/book/osdetect-methods.html">https://nmap.org/book/osdetect-methods.html</a>. </p>

        <p> And most importantly of all, fingerprinting techniques are constantly evolving all the time. Actively monitoring for new fingerprinting
        techniques and making those findings useful to everyone is time consuming and mostly unrewarding. If big corporations or powerful government 
        agencies want to track you, they will. </p>

        <p> For everyday Internet usage at least, evading fingerprinting is a fruitless persuit. </p>

        <h2> Safer </h2>
        <p> All this isn't to say that no effort should be made at all. Extensions like <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">ublock origin</a>
        block code that websites run which slow down your browsing experience and wastes computing resources. Extensions like 
        <a href="https://noscript.net/">noscript</a> prevents unrecognized websites from running Javascript code on your computer, reducing your 
        likelihood of being compromised by as-yet-unknown software vulnerabilities. </p>

        <p> All in all, mitigations above will make your browsing experience, if not private, safer and faster. </p>

        <h2> Tor </h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://torproject.org">Tor Browser</a> is one of the best options for anonymous communication online. The browser 
        attempts to keep up with the latest fingerprinting methods and implement mitigations for them. Tor also makes your network activity harder 
        to trace by redirecting network traffic across a global network of relays run by volunteers. The result is a resilient, private browsing 
        experience that is hard to rival. </p>

        <p> Note that Tor is not flawless and attacks by large threat actors are still possible. [3]</p>

        <h1> Evading fingerprinting may not be worth your time </h1>
        <p> 27/05/2022 </p>
        <p> There is a privacy.resistFingerprinting setting in Firefox that tries to thwart attempts by websites to fingerprint the browser.
        By, for example, preventing websites from automatically creating HTML canvas elements that can be used to unique identify your GPU 
        (and also your device), and reporting the false time zone and locale. [1] </p>

        <p> In theory, every user that turns on resistFingerprinting should look like they have the same browser configurations. Unique characteristics of a browser that, combined
        together, can be used to reliably re-identify a browser, are eliminated. Advertisers cannot build a profile of the websites a specific browser has visited in the past. </p>

        <p> resistFingerprinting alone is not enough to evade fingerprinting. There are many data points that do not rely on the configuration 
        of the browser. Because of the complexity of modern browsers, websites can test for certain new features, for example a new Javascript
        API, and components that are known to behave slightly differently between different browsers[2], to guess its browser, version, and
        operating system. When combined with other data, resistFingerprinting becomes useless. </p>

        <p> As the saying goes, the security of a system is only as strong as its weakest link. Posessing one unique data point that websites
        can use to identify you, and the game is up. </p>

        <p> For example, you cannot send the website an IP address that you do not have access to, websites won't know where to send your data. 
        IP addresses are assigned in such a way that users from the same region (or at least the same country) share some identical parts. They
        belong to the same range. This information is all public record and anyone can look up which range belongs where. </p>

        <p> This <i>one</i> data point can be eliminated by using an ideally popular and <i>trusted</i> VPN service, to not reveal your IP
        address when communicating online. However, there is no denying that a VPN is often troublesome. The use of a VPN as a tool to 
        eliminate that one data point becomes useless anyway when your browser consistently shares data like sign-in information with 
        websites part of your everyday browsing routine. </p>

        <p> The signed-in websites themselves can still connect your browser fingerprint to sign-in information such as cookies (or other shared 
        persisting data) to create a long-term profile of how your browser's fingerprint changes over time. Those websites often embed code that 
        run on other websites, whether because they provide a user analytics service or a "share button", which will enable them to build a 
        profile of websites you've visited. [3] </p>

        <p> And there are many other techniques that take advantage of the various subtle differences between devices. For example, all computers
        you communicate with online may identify your operating system by taking advantage of how different operating systems send and process
        network data with different patterns. (See <a href="https://nmap.org/book/osdetect-methods.html">https://nmap.org/book/osdetect-methods.html</a>)
        </p>

        <p> And most importantly of all, fingerprinting techniques are constantly evolving all the time. Actively monitoring for new fingerprinting
        techniques and making those findings useful to everyone is time consuming and unrewarding. If big corporations or powerful government agencies 
        want to track you specifically, they will. The point being that if you are going to ends such as enabling resistFingerprinting and reading this
        post, it is very likely you are putting a lot of effort into evading fingerprinting but getting suboptimal results.</p>

        <h2> Tor </h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://torproject.org">Tor Browser</a> 
        plugs most holes that may uniquely identify a user's computer, at the cost of convenience. If there is a new fingerprinting method, they
        will implement mitigations for them. Tor also makes your network activity harder to trace by redirecting network traffic across a global 
        network of relays run by volunteers. Tor is widely used, so websites cannot easily identify any single Tor user. </p>

        <p> Tor is not flawless and attacks are still possible [4]. I believe that it is currently the best solution for anonimity online. 
        You must read the Tor FAQ page first, in particular <a href="https://support.torproject.org/faq/staying-anonymous/"> this page on 
        staying anonymous on tor</a> before getting started. </p>

        <h2> Safer </h2>
        <p> Extensions like <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">ublock origin</a> block code that websites run to track your interactions and display 
        ads but which slow down your browsing experience by using additional bandwidth and time. </p>

        <p> Extensions like <a href="https://noscript.net/">noscript</a> prevents unrecognized websites from running Javascript code on your 
        computer, reducing your likelihood of being compromised by as-yet-unknown software vulnerabilities. noscript is a useful tool to 
        enhance security. If you're uncomfortable with blocking ads, you can always whitelist them. </p>
        
        <p> Lastly, disable WebGL. </p>

        <p> Mitigations above will make your browsing experience safer and faster. </p>

        <h2> Why write this? </h2>
        <p> I used to be obsessed with evading fingerprinting and "outsmarting the trackers". I hope that people who are still in the same 
        situation will realize that trying to evade fingerprinting <i>all on your own</i> is a time-consuming and unrewarding persuit. 
        When you want anonimity, launch Tor. Keep all everyday browsing on a regular browser on the clearnet. If possible, delete your 
        Facebook account. </p>
